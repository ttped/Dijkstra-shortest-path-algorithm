This is a sorting algorithm meant to find the shortest distances between any two locations.
The program takes the directed road network of Rome and then parses into a CSR array, which is used to represent location nodes.

To use the program open the executable file shortestPath.exe

Select option 2.

You will be asked to selected a node (a location) out 3353 nodes. The program will calculate all distances between
all other nodes from this location.

Once it is finished calculating all distances you can select another node to find out the shortest distance between the starting node
and the destination node.
